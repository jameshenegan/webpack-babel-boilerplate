# How to use this

```
git clone https://github.com/jameshenegan/webpack-babel-boilerplate.git
```

Copy all of the files (except for the `.git` stuff) into a new directory.

Enter that directory.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then when you start to edit the `./src/index.js` file, you should see those changes reflected in the `./dist/index.html` file.
